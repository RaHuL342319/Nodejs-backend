# Node: 
    Node is the runtime that allows you to write all your server-side tasks in JavaScript, like business logic, data persistence, and security. For example, it also adds functionalities that normal browser JavaScript doesn't have, like access to the local file system.

# Express: 
    Express is a framework that sits on top of Node and makes Node servers much easier to build and maintain.
