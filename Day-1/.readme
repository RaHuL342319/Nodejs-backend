Javascript is Multipurpose and Multi-paradigm Programming Language.

Q. How to Print something on console in Javascript?
--> By using console.log()
    e.g. console.log("Introduction to Javascript");

Types of Values in JS
* Null  
* undefined
* boolean  : true or false
* string : "String" or 'string' or 'a' or "A" 
* number : 3 , -3 , 4.5, 0 , -0
* symbol 



What is program and process?
-->  In simple word: If we write cde in a file that is program.
    and Program in running state is called process.

    Program gets converted in process.

    When process is running, inside the RAM, memory allocated for our process.


What is Variable?
--> We need something to store our values that is variable.
--> Variable is used to store values.
It is bucket in memory which store values.

How can we create Variables in javascript?
--> 
By using 3 keywords: i.e. let, var, const

let <variable-name> = <value>;
var <variable-name> = <value>;
const <variable-name> = <value>;

e.g. 
let name = "Rahul";
var age = 24;
const lastName = "Kumar";


Operators: Tool that can applied to two different operand to get some results.

1. typeof : It will return type of corresponding value as  string.
e.g. type 2 --> "number"
     for more example see typeof.js

2. Arithmetic Operator

+  :  Addition
-  : subtraction
*  : Multiplication
/  : Division
%  : Remainder

Note:  

If you want to do floor division there is 2 way
console.log(Math.floor(5/4));   // 1
console.log(parseInt(5/4));     // 1


3. Assignment Operator

=
+= 
-=
*=
/=
%=



4. Logical Operator 
Have you heard of logic gate in electronics or physics.

AND gate        ==>     &&         ==> logical AND
OR  gate        ==>     ||         ==> logical OR
NOT gate        ==>     !          ==> logical NOT

   
    Logical AND          
---------------------        
A       B      A && B           e.g  4 && 5  = 4
---------------------           e.g. 0 && 5  = 0
T       T       T               e.g. 3 && 0  = 0
T       F       F
F       T       F
F       F       F
---------------------

    
     Logical OR
---------------------
A       B      A || B
---------------------
T       T       T 
T       F       T
F       T       T
F       F       F
---------------------
